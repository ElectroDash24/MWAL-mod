# Mojang Works A Lot Mod

## Description

**Mojang Works A Lot Mod** is a mod designed to offer a "Vanilla Plus" experience by adding features suggested by the community and content that Mojang has declined to implement, such as sharks. The goal is to include things that players have been asking for, but Mojang seems too reluctant or "lazy" to add. 

The mod will introduce new creatures, biomes, blocks, tools, and mechanics that will enhance the core Minecraft experience without straying too far from its original feel. If you've ever wondered why some amazing ideas never made it into the game, **Mojang Works A Lot Mod** is here to bring those to life.

## Compatibility
* Minecraft version : 1.20.1
